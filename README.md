# Weather Report
Air pollution is like that unwelcome guest who overstays their welcome, making breathing a hassle, causing lung issues, and even messing with your heart. And it doesn’t help that weather conditions, like wind, temperature, and humidity, play a game of tag with pollutants, spreading them around or trapping them in one place like an unwanted fog. Traditional methods of predicting pollution are about as reliable as guessing the weather by looking out the window—way too many factors and way too much uncertainty. But fear not, deep learning is here to save the day! This high-tech superhero can sift through mountains of data, uncover hidden patterns, and make air pollution predictions much more accurate. Enter Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), a fancy AI model that looks at pollution data from both the past and future—kind of like a time traveler that helps cities jump into action before pollution becomes a problem. With better forecasting, authorities can give us early warnings, limit traffic, or even suggest working from home, keeping us safe from those toxic air surprises. Cities like Los Angeles and Shanghai are already using AI to tackle pollution, and the future is looking cleaner and healthier. So, thanks to deep learning, we might just be able to kick pollution to the curb and breathe a little easier—literally!
## PROBLEM STATEMENT & ABOUT
Air pollution is a major threat to public health, and the weather plays a big part in how pollutants spread, with factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed shaping air quality. The problem is, traditional forecasting models often struggle to predict these interactions accurately, which means we miss the chance to take timely action. But here’s where deep learning comes to the rescue! This project taps into the power of Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to better understand the link between weather patterns and air pollution. By processing data both forwards and backwards, Bi-LSTM boosts prediction accuracy, giving us the tools for early warnings, traffic control, and smarter policy decisions. With this approach, we can reduce health risks, make more informed environmental choices, and pave the way for more sustainable cities. It’s a win for both our health and the planet!
## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### Functional Requirements
### 1.Data Collection
Gather historical weather and pollution data from use sources like Central Pollution Control Board to ensure comprehensive and accurate data.
### 2.Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, normalize data ranges, and structure it in a time-series format suitable for deep learning.
Apply noise reduction techniques to filter out irrelevant data.
### 3.Model Development and Training
Develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Bi-Directional (LSTM) layers, including Confusing Matrix for predicting weather and pollution patterns .
Train the model using labeled datasets and optimize performance with Adam Optimizer.
### 4.Time-Series Forecasting
Provide forecasts over both short-term (daily) and long-term (weekly/monthly) intervals.

### 5.Visualization and Reporting
Provide clear visualizations of historical data, trends, and forecasted results for ease of interpretation.
Generate automated reports of daily Weather Conditions And Air Quality.
## NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 1.Performance Requirement:
The system should process and train models efficiently using LSTM with bidirectional layers for sequential data analysis. Predictions should be generated within a few seconds to minutes after training, ensuring quick response times. The training phase should support batch processing with an optimal batch size (e.g., 32) for efficient model training.
### 2.Scalability:
The system should support large datasets with multiple weather and air quality parameters. It should be capable of handling increasing data volumes over time without significant degradation in performance.
### 3.Maintainability:
The system should be modular, with each function handling specific tasks such as preprocessing, training, and evaluation. It should allow easy modification of forecasting parameters like lookback_days and forecast_days.
## PROPOSED METHODOLOGIES
Data Preprocessing:
Load and rename dataset columns.
Fill missing values with the mean.
Normalization using Min-Max scaling.
### 2.Sequence Creation:
Generate input-output sequences with a window size of 12 to predict the next value (one day ahead).
### 3. Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for model evaluation.
### 4.Model Definition:
Build a Bidirectional LSTM model with two LSTM layers and a Dense output layer. Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
### 5.Model Training:
Train the model on the training set and validate on the testing set, plotting the loss curve.
### 6.Predictions:
Make predictions on the test set and inverse transform the results to the original scale. Generate a confusion matrix to evaluate classification performance.
### 7.Future Predictions:
Train the model on the entire dataset and predict the next 30 days, saving results to CSV files for further analysis.
